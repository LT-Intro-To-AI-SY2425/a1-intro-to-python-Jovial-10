# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I like the simplicity of the language. It is a lot easier to learn than Java in my opinion.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Both Java and Python have a lot of similar data structures and jargon. Loops and interations are pretty similar whereas naming variables and defining functions are a bit different. 


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I have learned some of the basics of pythons and also some fundamental programs that will likely be useful to know for future assignments.
